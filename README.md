# Four Cards

This project is part of an ongoing series of code challenges from [FrontEndMentor](https://github.com/frontendmentorio).

Four Cards is a simple and static web page, containing no scripts whatsoever. 

Therefore, it could be done using only HTML and CSS, but I've decided to use React.js so I could practice factoring and code design.

For me, the hardest part of this challenge was correctly placing the four cards. To do so, I used the grid display with rows and columns.

## Technologies
